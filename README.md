# 💗 HerSpace – Personal Safety iOS App for Women

**HerSpace is an in-progress iOS safety app designed to give women fast, discreet, and reliable tools to protect themselves and stay connected in potentially unsafe situations.**  
Built with care using Swift and SwiftUI, HerSpace aims to support women from all walks of life — whether they’re students, solo travelers, or working professionals — by providing tools that enhance real-time safety and peace of mind.

## 🌍 Why HerSpace?

HerSpace was inspired by the emotional and raw stories told through [Mark Laita’s *Soft White Underbelly*](https://www.youtube.com/@SoftWhiteUnderbelly) — stories of women who have experienced human trafficking, sexual assault, harassment, and catcalling. These are dangers that many women face *daily*, while men often move through the world unaware of that constant risk.

As a young man who values and respects women deeply, I created HerSpace to serve as a real-world, tangible step toward allyship. This app is my personal contribution to making the world just a little safer for the women in it.

### 🧭 Live Location Sharing  
Share your real-time GPS location with trusted friends or family during commutes, night walks, or travel.

### ⏱️ SOS Timer  
Set a countdown timer for activities like jogging or heading home. If you don’t check in before it ends, the app auto-triggers an emergency alert.

Discreetly trigger a fake call to help you escape uncomfortable or dangerous situations.

### 🔕 Quick Exit Button  
Immediately exit the app and hide its activity — perfect for avoiding unwanted attention.

## 🙏 Final Note

HerSpace is more than just a portfolio project — it’s a reflection of what I believe technology can and should do: protect, empower, and serve people who are too often overlooked.

This app is being built with real intention, not just as code, but as a commitment to empathy in software.

Thank you for reading and supporting this vision.
